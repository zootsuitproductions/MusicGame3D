V2.89.0 - 2021-08-30
	Added OnMidiEvent can be used like a preprocessor of the MIDI events: it's possible to change the value of the MIDI events to modify in real time the song playing. [Pro]
	Added MPTK_TransExcludedChannel method useful to exclude a channel for transposing (in general, channel 9 for drums).
	Added MPTK_keepPlayingNonLooped properties: when set to true, NoteOff or Duration for non-looped samples are ignored and the samples play through to the end.
	Synth rate can be set to any value from the inspector or with MPTK_SynthRate.
	Output rate and buffer size can be modified when playing but only for test purpose.
	Added changing output rate and buffer size for iOS, but stay experimental.
	MPTK_ChannelPresetChange: apply bank and preset change even if not available but return false.
	MPTK_ChannelForcedPresetSet: apply bank and preset change even if not available but return false, able now to force bank.
	Added MPTK_RealTime properties: real time since the start of the MIDI.
	Added MPTK_KeepEndTrack properties: when set to true, meta MIDI event End Track are keep. Default is false.
	Added MPTK_TickLastNote properties: tick position for the last note-on found.
	Added MPTK_PositionLastNote properties: real time position in millisecond for the last note-on found in the MIDI.
	Added FootPrint capabilities: search a MIDI from a footprint and calculate a score tempo. [Pro]
	Added "Channel Exception" (MPTK_TransExcludedChannel) "Apply transpose on all channels except this one. -1 to apply all. Default is 9 because generally it's the drum channel and we don't want to transpose drum instruments!"
	Added "Real Time" (MPTK_RealTime) "Real time from the start of the playing. Tempo or speed change have no impact."
	Added "Keep MIDI EndTrack" (MPTK_KeepEndTrack) "When set to true, meta MIDI event End Track are keep and these MIDI events are taken into account for calculate the full duration of the MIDI."
	Added "Lean Synth Starting" (MPTK_LeanSynthStarting) "Sets the speed of the increase of the volume of the audio source when synth is starting."
	Added "Keep Playing Non Looped" (MPTK_KeepPlayingNonLooped) "When the option is on, non looped samples (drum samples for the most part) are play through to the end."
	Added "Release Time Modifier" (MPTK_ReleaseTimeMod) "Multiplier to increase or decrease the default release time defined in the SoundFont for each instrument."
	Added "Unity Audio Setting" (MPTK_AudioSettingFromUnity) "If checked then synth rate and buffer size will be automatically defined by Unity in accordance of the capacity of the hardware."
